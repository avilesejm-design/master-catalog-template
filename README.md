In corporate environments, agility is paramount. This tool eliminates the friction between data management and final user visualization:

Decentralized Management: Administrators update content directly via Google Sheets, removing the need for technical knowledge or GitHub access.

Adaptive Search: Instant filtering allows employees to find training materials in milliseconds, significantly enhancing the learning experience.

Zero-Cost Maintenance: A "Backend-less" architecture that leverages free professional tools to deliver enterprise-grade performance without operational expenses.

✨ UX Highlights
Zero-Friction Updates: Synchronous updating logic. Edit the spreadsheet, and the catalog updates automatically for all users worldwide.

Mobile-First Design: 100% responsive interface, optimized for "Just-in-time learning" across all mobile devices.

Reduced Cognitive Load: Clear visual hierarchy designed to help students focus on content discovery rather than navigation.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Modern UI), and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for high-speed filtering logic.
